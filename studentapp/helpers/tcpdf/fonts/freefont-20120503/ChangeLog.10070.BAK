2012-04-19 21:07 +0000 [r2226]  Stevan_White:

	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: re-named
	  alefmaksurainitialarabic and alefmaksuramedialarabic as
	  alefmaksurainitialarabic and alefmaksuramedialarabic to avoid a
	  confusing FontForge warning. This was discussed on the FontForge

	* FreeSerif.sfd: GPOS table: removed the
	  Cyrillic kerns with non-Unicode "alternative" Cyrillic, because
	  FontForge warns that Windows apps will have *problems* with
	  mappings that aren't Unicode-Unicode. Most of the kerns were
	  rather small anyway.

	  Persion digits 500EM wide.

2012-04-09 18:35 +0000 [r2205]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: messed with digits.
	  Overall, had been building with GIT version of FontForge. found
	  that older distro version 22-Feb-2011-ML shows warning dialogs
	  Internal Error: EITOfNextMajor failed! on Clockwise Test
	  (cleverly omitting the crucial info). Turns out, just rounding to
	  int on certain characters fixes it.

2012-04-09 11:34 +0000 [r2204]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: More kerning: tried
	  to synch up normal and bold. Altered letters especially for
	  Seraiki. Lots of fiddling with heh and heh-doachashmee. Seems the
	  letter transforms very differently for different languages. This
	  is not there yet.

2012-04-08 12:53 +0000 [r2203]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: made 'ccmp' table
	  and some combining marks to handle cases of letters that don't
	  have positional forms in Unicode. Only did a few -- more are
	  needed. Lots of kerning. Fiddled with shapes of several letters.

2012-04-07 19:21 +0000 [r2202]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Arabic: more alterations toward
	  bug #36115: Various little problems with Arabic/Persian glyphs
	  More kerning. Some forms from Pashto are missing.

2012-04-06 17:45 +0000 [r2201]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: made medial form of
	  loop-letters more distinctive from initial forms. (toward bug bug
	  #36115: Various little problems with Arabic/Persian glyphs)

2012-04-05 16:43 +0000 [r2200]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: improvements to
	  digits (Persian primarily) based on patch from Masoud Pourmoosa.

2012-04-04 17:10 +0000 [r2199]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic; (for Farsi) toward
	  bug 34700: made farsi yeh final more like the Unicode samples.
	  https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?34700 Arabic/Persian in FreeSerif:
	  ending "Yeh" is annoying

	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Various attempts to make
	  web fonts work/look better. Sans Devanagari: made relation
	  between overhang and horizontal more consistent for half-forms.
	  Corrected metrics in FreeSansOblique. Some kerning overall, after
	  looking again at sample pages

2012-04-02 13:30 +0000 [r2197]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansBold.sfd: Devanagari: toward more
	  consistent spacing, especialy of half-forms

2012-04-02 12:57 +0000 [r2196]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Devanagri: better connection of

2012-04-01 13:45 +0000 [r2195]  Stevan_White:

	  handling, doc

2012-03-28 19:20 +0000 [r2183]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd: Devanagari: cleaned up a
	  bunch of excess GPOS anchors; tidied lookups.

2012-03-28 09:17 +0000 [r2180-2182]  Stevan_White:

	* Makefile: insert troubleshooting doc

	* notes/troubleshooting.txt (added): A doc
	  explaining how to troubleshoot font problems.

	* notes/usage.txt: Tidied, more explanation of the
	  doc as a whole.

2012-03-26 10:43 +0000 [r2179]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: much experimenting
	  with lookups to center western punctuation between words
	  (resulted in several bug reports on firefox and xetex).
	  Currently, uses GSUB 'locl'. GPOS are too problematic in apps to
	  use.

2012-03-25 09:49 +0000 [r2178]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansBold.sfd: Devanagari: added
	  positioning for western punctuation

2012-03-25 09:40 +0000 [r2177]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,

	  hyphenated term

2012-03-24 10:20 +0000 [r2175]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Devanagari: regarding
	  horizontal spacing, on advice of Zdenek. o, au -- stems were too
	  close. danda, dbldanda: much too near preceding word. Made so
	  that danda-space would space the mark evenly between the words.
	  Made lookups for similarly-spaced question and exclamation marks.
	  Kerning (or dist?): Experiments -- problems include: Firefox
	  doesn't seem to support "dist". Xetex doesn't turn kerning on by
	  default. Fontforge complains Windows doesn't like to kern
	  auxiliaries with Unicode ranges. Nonetheless, it does pack words
	  rather tighter. My own advice: made ra glyph more narrow. It was
	  the worst, spacing wise, on the un-kerned page. Oriya: made
	  similar spacing for its danda.

2012-03-23 12:56 +0000 [r2174]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Devanagari: efforts to
	  improve horizontal spacing, that Zdenek complains about. 1)
	  medium: o, au vowels: stems too close 2) danda, dbldanda, should
	  be widely separated from words, centred between them. 3) bold: on
	  horizontal, bevels extend rather more than they should (reduced
	  in Unicode and through first set of half marks in the
	  auxiliaries... willl complete later.) 4) made special localized
	  forms of question, exclamation mark.

2012-03-22 23:25 +0000 [r2172-2173]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/generate/TrueType,
	  tools/generate/WOFF,
	  tools/generate/OpenType: Set the encoding to
	  UnicodeFull before build (a bit wasteful for faces with no high
	  Unicode, but couldn't think of a better way.)

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansBold.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: More re-thinking of OS/2
	  weights. In sans, again adjusted OS/2 Windows metrics to stop
	  clipping. (I'm just sure this will mess up line spacing in
	  OpenOffice, but didn't have time to check. Something has a bug.)

	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Overall: Several
	  measures toward reducing warnings from Font Validator. In "roman"
	  faces, change TTF Name: SubFamily to "Regular". (FontForge binds
	  this to PSNames:Weight --? so changed that.) Experimenting with
	  General:Name For Humans (Fiddled with Family Name too...but
	  changed it back.) Changes to OS/2:Sub/Super Subscript Offset --
	  made positive. Some fiddling with Panose info. Also: previously
	  OS/2 Charsets missed 708, Arabic ASMO 708. (Bug in
	  FontForge-patch reported.) In sans and mono oblique, bold, and
	  boldoblique, added some math operators to fill an Apple codepage.
	  Sinhala: FreeSerifBold -- implemented same change moving 'ccmp'
	  to 'akhn' as in roman face. Has to do with bug in OpenOffice/ICU.

2012-03-19 09:45 +0000 [r2163]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: correction-something went wrong
	  with the encoding two commits ago. (I switched encoding from
	  custom to BMP and back again.) This should encorporate the recent
	  changes and fix the problem.

2012-03-19 09:07 +0000 [r2162]  Stevan_White:

	  commit didn't quite do it. Sometimes, but starting the generate
	  process from scratch, it still crashed. But this "circle" glyph
	  was excessively elaborate anyway. Made it simpler, cleaned it up,
	  and now the crash isn't happening.

2012-03-09 13:12 +0000 [r2134]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Mahjong Tiles: work-around for

	  also bn_asamib_r_ukaar. Copied holes from similar glyphs. A
	  similar thing may have happend to a couple of other ligs
	  (bn_ss_tta1, bn_ss_tt_ra1). I don't know how these should look,
	  but they seem to be unused anyway.

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: mostly messing with
	  mark positioning: got rid of carat-reph forms.

2012-02-17 11:28 +0000 [r2065]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: further glyph
	  clean-up, adjustments to mark placement.

	  added some lookups for above marks.

2012-02-17 00:14 +0000 [r2062-2063]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Correction: kerning tables were
	  blown out in commit 2056. There were several bad crashes about
	  that time. The effect seems to be: all kern table entries are set
	  to 0.

	* sfd/Makefile, FreeSansBold.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: kerning tables restored.
	  Problem happened in commit 2096

2012-02-16 23:41 +0000 [r2061]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: more glyph clean-up,
	  mostly in auxiliaries. Just noticed all kern tables have been
	  zeroed again (thank you, FontForge).

2012-02-16 21:11 +0000 [r2060]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: glyph clean-up of
	  Unicode range, some of auxiliary glyphs.

2012-02-15 20:16 +0000 [r2059]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: more glyph clean-up,
	  re-naming. much more to do.

2012-02-15 17:12 +0000 [r2058]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujurati: removed anusvara and
	  nukta lookups in preference of positioning. general glyph
	  clean-up. deleted a bunch of unused characters. Oriya: general
	  glyph clean-up.

2012-02-14 23:59 +0000 [r2057]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: Again, from Samak
	  Gujarati font (full GPL 3.0 with font exception) Scaled slightly
	  to fit bounds, moved some letters, renamed a few. Lots more to
	  do.

2012-02-14 22:35 +0000 [r2056]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: reverting previous commit.
	  lookup tables somehow got damaged

2012-02-14 20:40 +0000 [r2055]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: From Samak Gujarati
	  font (full GPL 3.0 with font exception) Scaled slightly to fit
	  bounds, moved some letters, renamed a few. Lots more to do.

2012-02-14 19:37 +0000 [r2054]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Gujarati: Deleted range, over
	  questions of its provenance. Tut mir leid.

2012-02-13 23:16 +0000 [r2052-2053]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Tamil: cleaned up 'virama'
	  glyph.

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gurmukhi: cleaned up 'aa'
	  glyph.

2012-02-13 23:11 +0000 [r2051]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gurmukhi: cleaned up 'a' glyph.

2012-02-13 23:06 +0000 [r2049-2050]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Oriya: compacted auxiliary
	  glyphs a bit.

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Oriya: removed most holonto and
	  nukta forms in preference for positioning lookups

2012-02-13 21:08 +0000 [r2048]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Gujarati: made to validate

2012-02-13 20:55 +0000 [r2047]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Gujarati: regularized horizontal
	  placement and spacing, mostly increasing spacing a bit. Got rid
	  of nukta substitution table in favor of positioning lookup;
	  likewise with all anusvara lookups. The glyphs of this range are
	  still very erratic, and the weight is substantially greater than
	  that of the rest of the face.

2012-02-13 13:56 +0000 [r2046]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Gujarati: shifted entire range
	  up by 44EM, so it didn't dangle so. Fiddled with mark placement.

2012-02-13 00:01 +0000 [r2045]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gurmukhi: improved vowel a.

2012-02-12 23:29 +0000 [r2044]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gurmukhi: replaced range with
	  glyphs from 'singh' metafont by Amarjit Singh
	  http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/language/gurmukhi/ The 'singh'
	  font is properly GPL. And the overall look is much more like
	  serif than what had been there. Status: added a few letters and
	  tables. Two marks were unrepresented in 'singh', and are
	  leftovers. I made a ya_halant and a ra below-form. Also made
	  substitution and positioning tables. Worst: the vowel 'a' is very
	  messed up -- much too heavy; hand-drawn. Will have to replace it.
	  Also need to review the missing marks. Pity there's no bold...

2012-02-12 22:02 +0000 [r2043]  Stevan_White:

	  complete range. re-named letters for consistency with other indic
	  languages. fixed a broken table.

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Oriya: Re-introduced, using
	  Samak Oriya, a GPL v.3 + font exception.
	  http://sarovar.org/projects/samyak/ Already the original is
	  altered in several ways. The glyphs need a lot of work.

2012-02-10 12:03 +0000 [r2035]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/report/OpenType/UnicodeRanges.py: corrected
	  Private Use range

	  Malayalam: corrected problems caused by recent inconsistent
	  naming.

2012-02-09 16:36 +0000 [r2032]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Gujurati: named characters
	  better -- makes it easier to see table problems. Found one error
	  in tables, fixed. There are others.

2012-02-08 19:55 +0000 [r2031]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Tamil: several new tables in
	  effort to resolve spacing bug.

2012-02-08 15:37 +0000 [r2030]  Stevan_White:

2012-02-08 15:15 +0000 [r2029]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Tamil: Toward resolution of bug
	  #35479: Tamil in FreeSerif: some ligatures wrong
	  https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?35479 Removed GSUB tables
	  about positioning the virama; implemented this with a GPOS table
	  and anchor points. Corrected tables for sshri, kss ligatures.
	  Toward resolution of bug #35480: Tamil in FreeSerif: placement of
	  vowel marks poor https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?35480
	  Made a vertical ii sign, made a contextual chain that replaces
	  the normal ii with this one for certain letters.

2012-02-08 01:41 +0000 [r2028]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Malayalam: Added subtable for
	  nta (mal_n1rh), Separated 'psts' subtable into u and uu ones, and
	  everything else, hoping somehow to deal with the orthographic
	  reform.

	  Unicode additions

2012-02-06 19:24 +0000 [r2025]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd: Latin: Fixed broken
	  kerning. Problem was: there was an entry for 'f' as the first
	  letter in two subtables of the same lookup. The second subtable
	  was ignored, even though there was no match for the second letter
	  in the first lookup. That is, within a kern lookup, the first
	  letters of the pairs should be unique.

2012-02-06 14:41 +0000 [r2023-2024]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: Most of the
	  previous commits about Hindi were in error: two columns of the
	  velthuis manual for Modern Hindi and Old Hindi were swapped. This
	  now implements Modern Hindi, except for one conjunct. Old Hindi
	  conjuncts are moved to separate tables, but Old Hindi is not
	  specifically supported.

2012-01-23 18:48 +0000 [r1997]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: several table

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: Sanskrit/Hindi
	  distinction now seems to be working. (Was order of two 'akhn'
	  tables, one specialized for Sanskrit. Don't understand--thought
	  always all matching tables were executed.)

2012-01-20 01:41 +0000 [r1993]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: some clean-up,
	  split the akhn table into general (modern Hindi) and Sanskrit.
	  But not the Sanskrit doesn't activate in any environment, with
	  lang='sa'. However, seems to work for Hindi.

2012-01-18 14:40 +0000 [r1986]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: Much messing with
	  combined forms for vowels+rakh, finally got features going for
	  distinction of Rakaar slash vs Rakaar below mark.

2012-01-16 00:36 +0000 [r1985]  Stevan_White:

2012-01-08 01:32 +0000 [r1975]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: copied in rest of
	  Unicode chars from velthuis font dvng10.pfb with advice from
	  Zdeněk Wagner. Next plan: copy in ligatures from same file and
	  use a cmap file provided by Zdeněk to construct a basic GSUB
	  table.

2012-01-08 00:25 +0000 [r1974]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Latin, Cyrillic: tweeks to

	  the past... Cleaned up some lookups. In other ranges, added
	  script ranges for MS "new layout engine", e.g. dev2, bng2. Note:
	  Malayalam is mlm2, not mly2 as in Fontforge.

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Latin Extended-A:
	  Applied Daniel Johnson's patch that made two versions of capital
	  Eng. His explanation: ' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8A The
	  form of capital Eng currently in all three FreeFont faces is that
	  used by the Sami people, resembling a capital N with a hooked
	  right descender. However, the form preferred for African and
	  Amerindian languages resembles a tall lowercase n with a hook
	  that almost meets the left vertical. (See wikipedia link above
	  for a visual.) Recommend moving the existing Sami-style Eng to a
	  PUA or non-Unicode slot, creating African-style Eng at U+014A,
	  and adding a LOCL table with substitution rules for Inari Sami
	  (ISM), Lule Sami (LSM), Northern Sami (NSM) and Skolt Sami (SKS).
	  ' Latin Extended-B: Also in his patch: added U+0220 (Latin
	  Capital Letter N with long leg)

	  for extrema and self-intersection problmes . re-naming glyphs
	  whose PS names are too long. . removing blank glyphs . giving
	  Unicode points to glyphs missing them. There are still a few

	  lookups in somewhat better way. Control Pictures: added a bunch
	  (but... is it worth it?)

2010-09-12 15:01 +0000 [r1503]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/range_report.py: Added a Private Use total

2010-09-11 09:48 +0000 [r1498]  Stevan_White:

	  small letters to same depth as in Latin Expanded bowl of Fei and
	  fei to resemble other samples.

2010-09-10 21:38 +0000 [r1497]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Cyrillic: mostly positioning of
	  marks for old Cyrillic alphabets

2010-09-10 08:05 +0000 [r1496]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Coptic: Replaced acoptic with
	  something more dramatic, fiddled with kerning, tidied some other
	  letters

2010-09-08 22:50 +0000 [r1495]  Stevan_White:

	* AUTHORS, CREDITS: mention of recent

	  glyphs to re-order vowels, courtesy of Mohammad Anwari.

2010-09-07 17:39 +0000 [r1489]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Osmanya: courtesy of Daniel
	  Johnson. Note this script is slanted in every sample I've seen.
	  That is justification enough that the glyphs in this range look
	  slated, although the face isn't oblique.

2010-09-07 17:19 +0000 [r1488]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: UCAS Extended: by Daniel Johnson

2010-09-07 16:43 +0000 [r1487]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Sinhala: complete replacement
	  of range with glyphs extracted more directly from Yannis
	  Haralambous' sinha TeX font (last version was also derived from
	  this font, but had undergone detrimental processing). Implements
	  "rak" glyphs using three GSUB lookup steps.

2010-09-04 23:52 +0000 [r1486]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Fix for FontForge warning (v
	  20090923) "On Windows many apps will have problems with this
	  font's kerning, because because 58 of its glyph kern pairs cannot
	  be mapped to unicode-BMP kern pairs" This was due to kern tables
	  for the Musical Symbols range, which isn't in the Unicode Basic
	  Multilingual Plane. Removed this lookup. Might consider another
	  way to position these symbols.

2010-08-29 22:59 +0000 [r1485]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Resolves class of validation
	  problems in Sinhala: Bad Glyph Name. This is a FontForge bug,
	  that appears when certain types of problems occur in the glyph
	  contours. Probably an arithmetic error causes some corruption.

	* FreeMono.sfd: Named letters in several

2010-04-08 20:20 +0000 [r1433]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd: Fixed problem with name.
	  This should be the same as before the revision except for the
	  fix. The KDE font installer was saying this face was incorrectly
	  named Free Serif Bold Italic, but this wasn't quite correct. One
	  of the other language names said it was named Free Serif Halvfett
	  Kursiv, which conflicted with that language name for the real
	  Free Serif Bold Italic.

2010-04-08 17:26 +0000 [r1432]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd: regression: for some

	  response to FontForge complain that large names tables conflict
	  with recent Windows patches 2) because they are redundant and
	  inappropriate (Hope to post the list of sample texts elsewhere,
	  because I like the idea.)
